# wp-codekiri-theme
The wordpress theme used in my blog http://www.codekiri.com

## Installation
This is a child of the Apex Theme (https://github.com/BenSibley/apex), so first, you need to download the Apex wordpress theme 
into your "wp-content/themes" directory. After that, you have to download this theme in the same directory and activate it
from the administration panel of your wordpress blog.
